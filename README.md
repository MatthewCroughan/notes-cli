### I want to nest categories

Categories cannot be nested. Instead, you can define your own nested naming rule for categories.
For example `blog-personal-public` can indicate blog entries which is personal and publicly posted.
Other categories would be named like `blog-personal-private`, `blog-company-public`, ...
It's up to you.
