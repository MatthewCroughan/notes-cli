This is a small CLI tool for note taking in terminal with your favorite editor.
You can manage (create/open/list) notes via this tool on terminal.
This tool also optionally can save your notes thanks to Git to avoid losing your notes.

This tool is intended to be used nicely with other commands such as `grep` (or [ag][], [rg][]),
`rm`, filtering tools such as [fzf][] or [peco][] and editors which can be started from command line.
