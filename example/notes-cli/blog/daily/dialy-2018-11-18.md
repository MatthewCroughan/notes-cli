Today I improved wide characters support of `notes-cli`.
`notes` had some issues for this.

1. Body of note may ends with invalid wide character. Wide character may be split at middle of UTF8 code unit.
2. File name or category name may come from file path. And on (older) Mac, file paths are encoded with NFD. And Go does not care about NFC/NFD normalization

They are solved at v1.4.0
